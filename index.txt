About me

I'm a developer and AI enthusiast from India, with a B.Tech in Computer Engineering from NIT Kurukshetra. I specialize in building smart, scalable solutions using Generative AI, web technologies, and data science. I thrive on turning complex ideas into clean, functional, and user-friendly products.

My role is to build intelligent, user-focused applications that are functional and scalable, yet intuitive and visually engaging. From AI-powered chatbots to seamless full-stack platforms, I ensure each solution reflects innovation and usability. I have experience building GPT-4o-based analytics bots, e-commerce systems, and ML pipelines.
